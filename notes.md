=== Data Source ===

There are a lot of files in: `https://dumps.wikimedia.org/eswiki/latest/`. They are described in `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download`. Some of them are xml and some sql. Need to consider the most appropriate for me.

The corresponding dictionary page is `https://dumps.wikimedia.org/eswiktionary/`.


=== Processing Flow ===

In pseudocode:

1) Get wikipedia content
   * Format? Source?
   
2) Format each page's introduction into an anki note
   * Format of Anki notes? need intermediate representation?
   
3) Package the notes into a deck
